At 0+X, we strive to offer more than mere problem-solving.

For our team of consultants and experts, programming is not just an exercise in logic and technical skill but also a profoundly human endeavour that requires community, creativity, and collaboration to drive things forward. We invite you to follow in the footsteps of some of our most recent clients, including Spotify, Klarna, DICE, and Paradox Interactive, and join us in exploring tech's new frontiers.

We believe that if you can only see the stack as a precarious tower of problems, then your approach will inherently be limited to the narrow pursuit of solutions. Instead, we view the stack as a horizon, an unbounded space of potential that can only be realised through the right mix of expressivity, technology, and interoperability


<h3><b>Team</b></h3>

0+X has a diverse and international team of consultants, spanning more than 20 different nationalities from around the world. By joining 0+X, you become part of a team where you get the opportunity to learn from the best and work with the best. We will support you in every step and receive comprehensive and continuous career growth support. We are looking for dynamic personalities who will thrive in an environment where they work on different projects, meet new people, and enjoy being in a state of constant learning. Open-mindedness towards other people, cultures, and nationalities and a desire to relocate and continue a career in Stockholm are among the top indicators we pay attention to.

<h3><b>Community</b></h3>

The sense of community that we have at 0+X is a reflection of our passion for collaboration, creativity, open source, and experimentation. Learning events, workshops, meetups, mentorships, and gamejams are all regular features and help to facilitate the continual exchange of knowledge within the team. We also have annual summer and winter trips and a wide variety of team-building activities spanning everything from LAN events to board game evenings, to wall climbing, to Friday socials.   

<h3><b>Individuality</b></h3>

We strive to ensure that every consultant works on projects that suit them best. Our approach is fully individualised, so each team member will actively participate in conversations about which clients and projects they will be involved in. 

<h3><b>Full Relocation Support</b></h3>

We feel it is important to go above and beyond when it comes to assisting you in moving to Sweden to join 0+X. We strive to get you settled in as comfortably and easily as possible, so our relocation package is all-encompassing and includes full coverage of travel costs, assistance in apartment finding, and support in any and all administrative matters, including for family members (enrolling kids in schools or kindergarten, etc.) and even pets.


<h3><b>Benefit Package</b></h3>

At 0+X, we have a number of different budgets that feed into our overall employee benefit package. These include a wellness package, educational support, dental care, private pension, private healthcare, and a mortgage loan package (with a 2% interest rate), to name but a few.

<h3><b>Handbook</b></h3>

To help you settle in at 0+X, we have incorporated a handbook into our teamâ€™s Slack server filled with practical, hands-on advice and information about the company, our work environment, Sweden, and how to get settled in. Our Slack server is also a great place to get involved with the 0+X community, as it contains over 50 channels dedicated to hobbies, groups, and activities, and includes everything from Stockholm tips, to cycling, to game development, to lifehacks, to travel, and much more!
